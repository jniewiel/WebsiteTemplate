							<b>Black</b> is my favorite color for a variety of reasons. It is a neutral color. My main reason is that it is, in my opinion, the only color that 
						can aesthetically match with any other color. It influences what I wear and what I buy, no matter the product. Black is 
						a very popular color in almost everything we use today. All devices are sold or are available in black, and majority of clothing 
						includes either black or white. The President of the United States wears black suits, and gets driven in an all-black fleet of cars. 
						In the world of fashion, black is seen as sophisticated and has such an impact that whenever a new color trend occurs, 
						they call it "the new black". The color black also has a large influence in terms of darker negative topics such as evil or more importantly: death. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
							Black is the color of mourning, death, and sadness. Most societies traditionally wear all black during a person's funeral. In countries like Italy, Greece, 
						and Spain, widows will wear black for the rest of their lives while family members will wear black for an extended amount of time after the 
						passing. Black is also seen as a sign of evil, strength, power, and authority. As far as I know, I am not evil but I like to have the color on or beside me 
						as a sign of sophistication and elegance. I also like it due to its mystery and power. For example, a normal sports car looks cool but it doesn't really 
						have a sign of presence. If that same car is entirely in black, it makes itself stand out from everything else that is around it. It gives the mystery of who 
						might be inside, and gives both the car and person inside a sense of prestige.
